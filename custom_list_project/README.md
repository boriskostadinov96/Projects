# 6.Custom List
## <a href="https://github.com/boriskostadinov96/Projects/tree/main/custom_hash_table">Link to repository</a>

## Overview:
This project is a custom list implementation in Python, designed to mimic Python's built-in list but with added functionality such as dynamic resizing, sorting options, and robust error handling. The project includes unit tests to verify functionality.

## Features:
Dynamic List Storage:

- Stores elements with the capability to expand capacity as needed.

Automatic Resizing:

- Automatically expands the list's capacity when it reaches a set threshold.

Sorting:

- Supports sorting elements in ascending or descending order (still in development).

Error Handling:

- Raises appropriate exceptions (e.g., IndexError) for invalid operations, such as accessing elements out of range.

## Technologies Used:
- Python: Used for the core list functionality

- Unit Testing: : Tests are included to validate correct behavior of the list methods and error handling.
