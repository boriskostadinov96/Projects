## Overview:
This project is a custom list implementation in Python, designed to mimic Python's built-in list but with added functionality such as dynamic resizing, sorting options, and robust error handling. The project includes unit tests to verify functionality.
## Features:
Key-Value Storage:

- Stores unique key-value pairs, updating values for existing keys.

Automatic Resizing:

- Doubles capacity when full.

Sorting:

- Supports sorting by keys or values (ascending/descending; pending implementation).

Error Handling:

- Raises KeyError for missing keys.

## Technologies Used:
- Python: Used for the core list functionality

- Unit Testing: : Tests are included to validate correct behavior of the list methods and error handling.
